# Street-Lightning-System
This work demonstrates an easy, tough and energy efficient street light intensity control system which does not need much maintenance. The concept is sensing the brightness in the surrounding environment and controlling the intensity of street lights accordingly. LDR Sensor is affixed to sense the luminosity in the environment.  The system uses Arduino, a MOSFET is used for controlling the intensity of LEDs. A cluster of LEDs acts as a streetlight. The system is more dependable than systems with time slots and requires less perpetuation as compared to other available systems. At day time due to full environmental brightness, no LEDs are ON and the value of LDR remains constant. The intensity varies as time changes. At night due to zero environmental brightness, all LEDs are NO at their full intensity and the value of LDR here too remains constant as the LDR would not sense any light all night. Hence this approach saves electrical energy as well as man power.
